PAGE PLANNING WITH RELATIVE DOCUMENTS

Ganto yan, may 3 types of work na need gawin.
   1. Addition of narratives:
      - dadagdagan lang yung mga dati nang nasa page
   2. Rebuild of old pages:
      - Irere-imagine or irerenovate yung dating page with new narrative documents
   3. Making New Pages
      - self explanatory 


HEADER: Button Arrangement
   - NEWS
   - PROCESS
   - CATEGORIES
   - ABOUT US

> HOMEPAGE (REBUILD)
   > remove the eligibility button
   > DOCUMENT: HOMEPAGE.docx

1. NEWS
   - wala pang napagusapan dito, ako na siguro muna bahala here 

2. PROCESS (NEW PAGES)
   - Process will now have a dropdown page feature. The dropdown will contain links of the ff.
      > Family Based (PROCESS OF FAMILY BASED.docx)
      > Study & Exchange (PROCESS OF J1.docx)
      > Temporary Employment (PROCESS OF H2A.docx + PROCESS OF EB3.docx)
   - Each tab/page will contain a button just like homepage (CHECK ELIGIBILITY) after the narratives. This button will lead them to the respective "CATEGORIES" tab which contains the "ELIGIBILITY FORM (formerly INTEREST FORM)" for each visa

3. CATEGORIES (ako na bahala dito)
   - create iterations of the interest form (will now be called eligibility form)

4. ABOUT US (Rebuild)
   > Remove old Consultation process (disclaimer page)
   > Old page's narrative was rushed (by maam mimi) may bago siyang ginawang narrative for this page.

   Things to change: 
      OUR MISSION
      OUR VISION
      SPECIALIZATION (yung narrative lang ahh. yung "West Migration Agency LLC ("WMA") assists noncitizens...")
